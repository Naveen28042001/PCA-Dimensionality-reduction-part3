    "Geometrically, an eigenvector represents a direction in the vector space that remains unchanged in direction when the corresponding linear transformation (represented by the matrix) is applied. However, it may be scaled by a factor, which is the eigenvalue. This means that the eigenvector points in a direction that is stretched or compressed by the transformation but remains parallel to its original direction. In the case of a 2D space, the eigenvectors represent the directions of the axes of the stretched or compressed ellipse after the transformation.\n",

    "Geometrically, eigenvalues represent the factors by which the corresponding eigenvectors are scaled or stretched. If the eigenvalue is greater than 1, it implies that the transformation stretches the space along the direction of the eigenvector. If the eigenvalue is between 0 and 1, it indicates that the transformation compresses the space along the direction of the eigenvector. A negative eigenvalue reflects a transformation that also includes a reflection across the origin.\n",

It allows us to visualize how the space is stretched, compressed, or reflected under the action of a given matrix.
